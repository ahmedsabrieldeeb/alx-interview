## Pascal's Triangle and Python Implementation

This markdown file describes Pascal's Triangle and presents a Python solution to generate it.

### What is Pascal's Triangle?

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept visualized as a triangular array of numbers. It has numerous applications in combinatorics, probability theory, and other areas of mathematics.

**Properties:**

* The first row always consists of the number 1.
* Each subsequent row starts and ends with 1.
* Any internal element is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the preceding row.

Here's an example of Pascal's Triangle with the first 5 rows:


### Python Implementation

This Python code defines a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows (`n`).

```python
def pascal_triangle(n: int) -> list[list[int]]:
  """
  Generate Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

  Args:
      n (int): The number of rows to generate in the triangle.

  Returns:
      List[List[int]]: A list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.

  """

  if (n <= 0):
    print("Invalid! Please enter positive integer number of rows")
    exit(1)

  pascal = []
  pascal.append([1])  # First row is always 1

  for i in range(1, n):
    rowList = [1] * (i + 1)  # Initialize row with 1s (i+1 elements)

    for j in range(1, i):
      rowList[j] = pascal[i - 1][j - 1] + pascal[i - 1][j]  # Calculate internal elements

    pascal.append(rowList)

  return pascal
```

## Explanation

The provided Python code defines a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows (`n`). Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Input Validation:**
    - The function starts by checking if the input `n` (number of rows) is less than or equal to zero (`n <= 0`).
    - If it is, the function prints an error message and exits the program using `exit(1)`.

2. **Initializing the Triangle:**
    - An empty list named `pascal` is created to store the rows of the triangle.
    - The first row of Pascal's Triangle always consists of the number 1, so a list containing `[1]` is appended to the `pascal` list.

3. **Iterating through Rows:**
    - A `for` loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n - 1` (excluding the first row already added). This ensures we generate `n` rows.

4. **Creating a New Row:**
    - Inside the loop, an empty list named `rowList` is created with a length of `i + 1`. This represents the current row, which will have `i + 1` elements.
    - All elements in `rowList` are initialized to 1 using list comprehension `[1] * (i + 1)`. This sets the first and last elements (which are always 1) and placeholders for calculations.

5. **Calculating Internal Elements:**
    - Another `for` loop iterates through the elements of the current row (`rowList`), starting from the second element (index 1) and excluding the last element (since they are already 1). This focuses on the internal elements that need calculation.
    - Inside this loop:
        - The value of the current element (`rowList[j]`) is calculated by adding the corresponding elements from the previous row (`pascal[i - 1][j - 1]` and `pascal[i - 1][j]`). This leverages the property that each internal element is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the preceding row.

6. **Appending the Row:**
    - After calculating all internal elements, the completed `rowList` is appended to the `pascal` list. This adds the current row to the growing Pascal's Triangle.

7. **Returning the Result:**
    - Once the loop completes, the function returns the final `pascal` list, which represents the generated Pascal's Triangle.

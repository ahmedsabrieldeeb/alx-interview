## Problem Description

You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that determines if all the boxes can be opened.


## Prototype
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
    Determines if all the boxes in the given list can be unlocked.

    Args:
        boxes (list): A list of lists representing the lockboxes.
                      Each inner list contains the keys to other boxes.

    Returns:
        bool: True if all boxes can be unlocked, False otherwise.
    """
    ## setup the algorithm
    num_boxes = len(boxes)
    visited = [0] * num_boxes
    visited[0] = 1

    ## start search
    dfs_traversal(boxes[0], boxes, visited, num_boxes)

    ## check whether all nodes visited or not
    if 0 in visited:
        return False
    else:
        return True



def dfs_traversal(box, boxes, visited, num_boxes):
    """
    Perform a depth-first search traversal on a box and its sub-boxes.

    Args:
        box (list): The current box being visited.
        boxes (list): The list of all boxes.
        visited (list): A list to keep track of visited boxes.
        num_boxes (int): The total number of boxes.

    Returns:
        Void: returns nothing
    """
    for key in box:
        # only visit boxes existed and hasn't been visited
        if key < num_boxes and visited[key] == 0:
            visited[key] = 1
            dfs_traversal(boxes[key], boxes, visited, num_boxes)
```

## Example
```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes)) # True

boxes = [[1, 2], [3], [4], [], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes)) # False
```

## Solution Description

The `canUnlockAll` function is the main function that takes a list of lists, `boxes`, as an argument. Each inner list represents a box and contains keys to other boxes. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether all boxes can be unlocked or not.

### Initialization

The function starts by initializing some variables. `num_boxes` is set to the length of `boxes`, representing the total number of boxes. `visited` is a list of zeros with the same length as `boxes`, used to keep track of which boxes have been visited (or unlocked). The first box (box 0) is considered visited by default, so `visited[0]` is set to 1.

### Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal

The function then calls `dfs_traversal` with the keys in the first box, the list of all boxes, the `visited` list, and the total number of boxes. This initiates a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the first box.

### Post-Traversal Check

After the DFS traversal, the function checks if there are any unvisited boxes left (represented by zeros in the `visited` list). If there are, it returns False, indicating that not all boxes can be unlocked. Otherwise, it returns True.

### DFS Traversal Function

The `dfs_traversal` function performs the actual DFS traversal. It takes a box (a list of keys), the list of all boxes, the `visited` list, and the total number of boxes as arguments. For each key in the current box, if the key is a valid box number and that box hasn't been visited yet, it marks the box as visited and recursively calls `dfs_traversal` on the new box. This process continues until all reachable boxes have been visited.

### Summary

In summary, this solution uses a DFS traversal to visit each box that can be unlocked with the available keys, starting from the first box. It then checks if all boxes have been visited to determine if all boxes can be unlocked.
